# Risk Policy Council Weighting form

A shiny app survey produced for the purposes of completing the risk policy weighting by the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) voting members. Factor weights from the Council members will be combined with the [factor scores](https://github.com/AngeliaMiller/nefmc-risk-scoring) determined by the Plan Development teams of the respective fishery management plans (FMPs) to apply the Council's Risk Policy in their decision making. 

The app was developed using the [surveydown R package](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown).
